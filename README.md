# D3-challenge

Created a scatter plot to show the relationship between Healthcare and Poverty by state using the data provided in csv.

Used D3 to represent each state with circle elements and included state abbreviations in the circles.

From the data, it appears that those states with higher poverty rates also have higher rates of people who lack halthcare.
